# Notes

1. Remove buttons and add links instead + make the link a component => to="" interpolate path to display the correct product
2. Add JSON File or use an array with objects to iterate over data to minimize the duplicate pages and DRY the code.
3. find a way to not pass onProductAdd through three components to reach the button
4. use custom hooks to refactor code, like the sum function of the cart can be a custom hook
5. remove smooth scrolling?
6. empty card after conformation o
7. save cart in local storage
